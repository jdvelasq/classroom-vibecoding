Kimball Dimensional Modeling Techniques

<!-- fin de página 3 -->

Ralph Kimball introduced the data warehouse/business intelligence industry to dimensional modeling in
1996 with his seminal book, _The Data Warehouse Toolkit_ . Since then, the Kimball Group has extended
the portfolio of best practices. Drawn from _The Data Warehouse Toolkit, Third Edition_ (coauthored by
Ralph Kimball and Margy Ross, 2013), here are the “official” Kimball dimensional modeling techniques.

## **Fundamental Concepts**


**Gather Business Requirements and Data Realities**

Before launching a dimensional modeling effort, the team needs to understand the needs of the
business, as well as the realities of the underlying source data. You uncover the requirements via
sessions with business representatives to understand their objectives based on key performance
indicators, compelling business issues, decision-making processes, and supporting analytic needs. At
the same time, data realities are uncovered by meeting with source system experts and doing high-level
data profiling to assess data feasibilities.

**Collaborative Dimensional Modeling Workshops**

Dimensional models should be designed in collaboration with subject matter experts and data
governance representatives from the business. The data modeler is in charge, but the model should
unfold via a series of highly interactive workshops with business representatives. These workshops
provide another opportunity to flesh out the requirements with the business. Dimensional models should
not be designed in isolation by folks who don’t fully understand the business and their needs;
collaboration is critical!

**Four-Step Dimensional Design Process**

The four key decisions made during the design of a dimensional model include:


1. Select the business process.

2. Declare the grain.

3. Identify the dimensions.

4. Identify the facts

The answers to these questions are determined by considering the needs of the business along with the
realities of the underlying source data during the collaborative modeling sessions. Following the
business process, grain, dimension, and fact declarations, the design team determines the table and
column names, sample domain values, and business rules. Business data governance representatives
must participate in this detailed design activity to ensure business buy-in.

**Business Processes**

_Business processes_ are the operational activities performed by your organization, such as taking an
order, processing an insurance claim, registering students for a class, or snapshotting every account
each month. Business process events generate or capture performance metrics that translate into facts
in a fact table. Most fact tables focus on the results of a single business process. Choosing the process
is important because it defines a specific design target and allows the grain, dimensions, and facts to be
declared. Each business process corresponds to a row in the enterprise data warehouse bus matrix.

<!-- fin de página 4 -->

**Grain**

Declaring the grain is the pivotal step in a dimensional design. The grain establishes exactly what a
single fact table row represents. The grain declaration becomes a binding contract on the design. The
grain must be declared before choosing dimensions or facts because every candidate dimension or fact
must be consistent with the grain. This consistency enforces a uniformity on all dimensional designs that
is critical to BI application performance and ease of use. Atomic grain refers to the lowest level at which
data is captured by a given business process. We strongly encourage you to start by focusing on atomicgrained data because it withstands the assault of unpredictable user queries; rolled-up summary grains
are important for performance tuning, but they pre-suppose the business’s common questions. Each
proposed fact table grain results in a separate physical table; different grains must not be mixed in the
same fact table.

**Dimensions for Descriptive Context**

Dimensions provide the “who, what, where, when, why, and how” context surrounding a business
process event. Dimension tables contain the descriptive attributes used by BI applications for filtering
and grouping the facts. With the grain of a fact table firmly in mind, all the possible dimensions can be
identified. Whenever possible, a dimension should be single valued when associated with a given fact
row. Dimension tables are sometimes called the “soul” of the data warehouse because they contain the
entry points and descriptive labels that enable the DW/BI system to be leveraged for business analysis.
A disproportionate amount of effort is put into the data governance and development of dimension tables
because they are the drivers of the user’s BI experience.

**Facts for Measurements**

_Facts_ are the measurements that result from a business process event and are almost always numeric. A
single fact table row has a one-to-one relationship to a measurement event as described by the fact
table’s grain. Thus a fact table corresponds to a physical observable event, and not to the demands of a
particular report. Within a fact table, only facts consistent with the declared grain are allowed. For
example, in a retail sales transaction, the quantity of a product sold and its extended price are good
facts, whereas the store manager’s salary is disallowed.

**Star Schemas and OLAP cubes**

_Star schemas_ are dimensional structures deployed in a relational database management system
(RDBMS). They characteristically consist of fact tables linked to associated dimension tables via primary/
foreign key relationships. An _online analytical processing (OLAP) cube_ is a dimensional structure
implemented in a multidimensional database; it can be equivalent in content to, or more often derived
from, a relational star schema. An OLAP cube contains dimensional attributes and facts, but it is
accessed through languages with more analytic capabilities than SQL, such as XMLA. OLAP cubes are
included in this list of basic techniques because an OLAP cube is often the final step in the deployment
of a dimensional DW/BI system, or may exist as an aggregate structure based on a more atomic
relational star schema.

**Grace Extensions to Dimensional Modeling**

Dimensional models are resilient when data relationships change. All the following changes can be
implemented without altering any existing BI query or application, and without any change in query
results.


    - Facts consistent with the grain of an existing fact table can be added by creating new columns.


    - Dimensions can be added to an existing fact table by creating new foreign key columns,
presuming they don’t alter the fact table’s grain.


    - Attributes can be added to an existing dimension table by creating new columns.


    - The grain of a fact table can be made more atomic by adding attributes to an existing dimension
table, and then restating the fact table at the lower grain, being careful to preserve the existing
column names in the fact and dimension tables.

## **Basic Fact Table Techniques**

**Fact Table Structure**

A _fact table_ contains the numeric measures produced by an operational measurement event in the
real world. At the lowest grain, a fact table row corresponds to a measurement event and vice versa.
Thus the fundamental design of a fact table is entirely based on a physical activity and is not
influenced by the eventual reports that may be produced. In addition to numeric measures, a fact
table always contains foreign keys for each of its associated dimensions, as well as optional
degenerate dimension keys and date/time stamps. Fact tables are the primary target of computations
and dynamic aggregations arising from queries.

**Additive, Semi-Additive, and Non-Additive Facts**
The numeric measures in a fact table fall into three categories. The most flexible and useful facts are
fully _additive_ ; additive measures can be summed across any of the dimensions associated with the
fact table. _Semi-additive_ measures can be summed across some dimensions, but not all; balance
amounts are common semi-additive facts because they are additive across all dimensions except
time. Finally, some measures are completely _non-additive_, such as ratios. A good approach for nonadditive facts is, where possible, to store the fully additive components of the non-additive measure
and sum these components into the final answer set before calculating the final non-additive fact.
This final calculation is often done in the BI layer or OLAP cube.

**Nulls in Fact Tables**

Null-valued measurements behave gracefully in fact tables. The aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT,
MIN, MAX, and AVG) all do the “right thing” with null facts. However, nulls must be avoided in the
fact table’s foreign keys because these nulls would automatically cause a referential integrity
violation. Rather than a null foreign key, the associated dimension table must have a default row (and
surrogate key) representing the unknown or not applicable condition.

**Conformed Facts**

If the same measurement appears in separate fact tables, care must be taken to make sure the
technical definitions of the facts are identical if they are to be compared or computed together. If the
separate fact definitions are consistent, _the conformed facts_ should be identically named; but if they
are incompatible, they should be differently named to alert the business users and BI applications.

**Transaction Fact Tables**

A row in a _transaction fact table_ corresponds to a measurement event at a point in space and time.
Atomic transaction grain fact tables are the most dimensional and expressive fact tables; this robust
dimensionality enables the maximum slicing and dicing of transaction data. Transaction fact tables
may be dense or sparse because rows exist only if measurements take place. These fact tables
always contain a foreign key for each associated dimension, and optionally contain precise time
stamps and degenerate dimension keys. The measured numeric facts must be consistent with the
transaction grain.

<!-- fin de página 7 -->

**Periodic Snapshot Fact Tables**

A row in a _periodic snapshot fact table_ summarizes many measurement events occurring over a
standard period, such as a day, a week, or a month. The grain is the period, not the individual
transaction. Periodic snapshot fact tables often contain many facts because any measurement event
consistent with the fact table grain is permissible. These fact tables are uniformly dense in their
foreign keys because even if no activity takes place during the period, a row is typically inserted in
the fact table containing a zero or null for each fact.

**Accumulating Snapshot Fact Tables**

A row in an _accumulating snapshot fact table_ summarizes the measurement events occurring at
predictable steps between the beginning and the end of a process. Pipeline or workflow processes,
such as order fulfillment or claim processing, that have a defined start point, standard intermediate
steps, and defined end point can be modeled with this type of fact table. There is a date foreign key
in the fact table for each critical milestone in the process. An individual row in an accumulating
snapshot fact table, corresponding for instance to a line on an order, is initially inserted when the
order line is created. As pipeline progress occurs, the accumulating fact table row is revisited and
updated. This consistent updating of accumulating snapshot fact rows is unique among the three
types of fact tables. In addition to the date foreign keys associated with each critical process step,
accumulating snapshot fact tables contain foreign keys for other dimensions and optionally contain
degenerate dimensions. They often include numeric lag measurements consistent with the grain,
along with milestone completion counters.

**Factless Fact Tables**

Although most measurement events capture numerical results, it is possible that the event merely
records a set of dimensional entities coming together at a moment in time. For example, an event of
a student attending a class on a given day may not have a recorded numeric fact, but a fact row with
foreign keys for calendar day, student, teacher, location, and class is well-defined. Likewise,
customer communications are events, but there may be no associated metrics. _Factless fact tables_
can also be used to analyze what didn’t happen. These queries always have two parts: a factless
coverage table that contains all the possibilities of events that might happen and an activity table that
contains the events that did happen. When the activity is subtracted from the coverage, the result is
the set of events that did not happen.

**Aggregate Fact Tables or Cubes**

_Aggregate fact tables_ are simple numeric rollups of atomic fact table data built solely to accelerate
query performance. These aggregate fact tables should be available to the BI layer at the same time
as the atomic fact tables so that BI tools smoothly choose the appropriate aggregate level at query
time. This process, known as _aggregate navigation_, must be _open_ so that every report writer, query
tool, and BI application harvests the same performance benefits. A properly designed set of
aggregates should behave like database indexes, which accelerate query performance but are not
encountered directly by the BI applications or business users. Aggregate fact tables contain foreign
keys to shrunken conformed dimensions, as well as aggregated facts created by summing measures
from more atomic fact tables. Finally, _aggregate OLAP cubes_ with summarized measures are
frequently built in the same way as relational aggregates, but the OLAP cubes are meant to be
accessed directly by the business users.

<!-- fin de página 8 -->

**Consolidated Fact Tables**

It is often convenient to combine facts from multiple processes together into a single _consolidated_
_fact table_ if they can be expressed at the same grain. For example, sales actuals can be consolidated
with sales forecasts in a single fact table to make the task of analyzing actuals versus forecasts
simple and fast, as compared to assembling a drill-across application using separate fact tables.
Consolidated fact tables add burden to the ETL processing, but ease the analytic burden on the BI
applications. They should be considered for cross-process metrics that are frequently analyzed
together.

## **Basic Dimension Table Techniques**

**Dimension Table Structure**

Every dimension table has a single primary key column. This primary key is embedded as a foreign
key in any associated fact table where the dimension row’s descriptive context is exactly correct for
that fact table row. Dimension tables are usually wide, flat denormalized tables with many lowcardinality text attributes. While operational codes and indicators can be treated as attributes, the
most powerful dimension attributes are populated with verbose descriptions. Dimension table
attributes are the primary target of constraints and grouping specifications from queries and BI
applications. The descriptive labels on reports are typically dimension attribute domain values.

**Dimension Surrogate Keys**

A dimension table is designed with one column serving as a unique primary key. This primary key
cannot be the operational system’s natural key because there will be multiple dimension rows for that
natural key when changes are tracked over time. In addition, natural keys for a dimension may be
created by more than one source system, and these natural keys may be incompatible or poorly
administered. The DW/BI system needs to claim control of the primary keys of all dimensions; rather
than using explicit natural keys or natural keys with appended dates, you should create anonymous
integer primary keys for every dimension. These _dimension surrogate keys_ are simple integers,
assigned in sequence, starting with the value 1, every time a new key is needed. The date dimension
is exempt from the surrogate key rule; this highly predictable and stable dimension can use a more
meaningful primary key.

**Natural, Durable, and Supernatural Keys**

_Natural keys_ created by operational source systems are subject to business rules outside the control
of the DW/BI system. For instance, an employee number (natural key) may be changed if the
employee resigns and then is rehired. When the data warehouse wants to have a single key for that
employee, a new _durable key_ must be created that is persistent and does not change in this situation.
This key is sometimes referred to as a _durable supernatural key_ . The best durable keys have a
format that is independent of the original business process and thus should be simple integers
assigned in sequence beginning with 1. While multiple surrogate keys may be associated with an
employee over time as their profile changes, the durable key never changes.

**Drilling Down**

_Drilling down_ is the most fundamental way data is analyzed by business users. Drilling down simply
means adding a row header to an existing query; the new row header is a dimension attribute
appended to the GROUP BY expression in an SQL query. The attribute can come from any
dimension attached to the fact table in the query. Drilling down does not require the definition of
predetermined hierarchies or drill-down paths.

**Degenerate Dimensions**
Sometimes a dimension is defined that has no content except for its primary key. For example, when
an invoice has multiple line items, the line item fact rows inherit all the descriptive dimension foreign
keys of the invoice, and the invoice is left with no unique content. But the invoice number remains a
valid dimension key for fact tables at the line item level. This _degenerate dimension_ is placed

<!-- fin de página 10 -->

in the fact table with the explicit acknowledgment that there is no associated dimension table.
Degenerate dimensions are most common with transaction and accumulating snapshot fact tables.

**Denormalized Flattened Dimensions**

In general, dimensional designers must resist the normalization urges caused by years of operational
database designs and instead denormalize the many-to-one fixed depth hierarchies into separate
attributes on a flattened dimension row. Dimension denormalization supports dimensional modeling’s
twin objectives of simplicity and speed.

**Multiple Hierarchies in Dimensions**

Many dimensions contain more than one natural hierarchy. For example, calendar date dimensions
may have a day to week to fiscal period hierarchy, as well as a day to month to year hierarchy.
Location intensive dimensions may have multiple geographic hierarchies. In all of these cases, the
separate hierarchies can gracefully coexist in the same dimension table.

**Flags and Indicators as Textual Dimension Attributes**
Cryptic abbreviations, true/false flags, and operational indicators should be supplemented in
dimension tables with full text words that have meaning when independently viewed. Operational
codes with embedded meaning within the code value should be broken down with each part of the
code expanded into its own separate descriptive dimension attribute.

**Null Attributes in Dimensions**

Null-valued dimension attributes result when a given dimension row has not been fully populated, or
when there are attributes that are not applicable to all the dimension’s rows. In both cases, we
recommend substituting a descriptive string, such as Unknown or Not Applicable in place of the null
value. Nulls in dimension attributes should be avoided because different databases handle grouping
and constraining on nulls inconsistently.

**Calendar Date Dimensions**

_Calendar date dimensions_ are attached to virtually every fact table to allow navigation of the fact
table through familiar dates, months, fiscal periods, and special days on the calendar. You would
never want to compute Easter in SQL, but rather want to look it up in the calendar date dimension.
The calendar date dimension typically has many attributes describing characteristics such as week
number, month name, fiscal period, and national holiday indicator. To facilitate partitioning, the
primary key of a date dimension can be more meaningful, such as an integer representing
YYYYMMDD, instead of a sequentially-assigned surrogate key. However, the date dimension table
needs a special row to represent unknown or to-be-determined dates. Filtering and grouping should
be based on the date dimension’s attributes, not the smart key. When further precision is needed, a
separate date/time stamp can be added to the fact table. The date/time stamp is not a foreign key to
a dimension table, but rather is a standalone column. If business users constrain or group on time-ofday attributes, such as day part grouping or shift number, then you would add a separate time-of-day
dimension foreign key to the fact table.

<!-- fin de página 11 -->

**Role-Playing Dimensions**

A single physical dimension can be referenced multiple times in a fact table, with each reference
linking to a logically distinct role for the dimension. For instance, a fact table can have several dates,
each of which is represented by a foreign key to the date dimension. It is essential that each foreign
key refers to a separate view of the date dimension so that the references are independent. These
separate dimension views (with unique attribute column names) are called roles.

**Junk Dimensions**
Transactional business processes typically produce a number of miscellaneous, low-cardinality flags
and indicators. Rather than making separate dimensions for each flag and attribute, you can create a
single _junk dimension_ combining them together. This dimension, frequently labeled as a _transaction_
_profile dimension_ in a schema, does not need to be the Cartesian product of all the attributes’
possible values, but should only contain the combination of values that actually occur in the source
data.

**Snowflaked Dimensions**

When a hierarchical relationship in a dimension table is normalized, low-cardinality attributes appear
as secondary tables connected to the base dimension table by an attribute key. When this process is
repeated with all the dimension table’s hierarchies, a characteristic multilevel structure is created that
is called a _snowflake_ . Although the snowflake represents hierarchical data accurately, you should
avoid snowflakes because it is difficult for business users to understand and navigate snowflakes.
They can also negatively impact query performance. A flattened denormalized dimension table
contains exactly the same information as a snowflaked dimension.

**Outrigger Dimensions**

A dimension can contain a reference to another dimension table. For instance, a bank account
dimension can reference a separate dimension representing the date the account was opened.
These secondary dimension references are called _outrigger dimensions_ . Outrigger dimensions are
permissible, but should be used sparingly. In most cases, the correlations between dimensions
should be demoted to a fact table, where both dimensions are represented as separate foreign keys.

## **Integration via Conformed Dimensions**

**Conformed Dimensions**

Dimension tables _conform_ when attributes in separate dimension tables have the same column
names and domain contents. Information from separate fact tables can be combined in a single
report by using conformed dimension attributes that are associated with each fact table. When a
conformed attribute is used as the row header (that is, the grouping column in the SQL query), the
results from the separate fact tables can be aligned on the same rows in a drill-across report. This is
the essence of integration in an enterprise DW/ BI system. _Conformed dimensions_, defined once in
collaboration with the business’s data governance representatives, are reused across fact tables;
they deliver both analytic consistency and reduced future development costs because the wheel is
not repeatedly re-created

**Shrunken Rollup Dimensions**

_Shrunken dimensions_ are conformed dimensions that are a _subset_ of rows and /or columns of a base

dimension. _Shrunken rollup_ dimensions are required when constructing aggregate fact tables. They
are also necessary for business processes that naturally capture data at a higher level of granularity,
such as a forecast by month and brand (instead of the more atomic date and product associated with
sales data). Another case of conformed dimension subsetting occurs when two dimensions are at the
same level of detail, but one represents only a subset of rows.

**Drilling Across**

_Drilling across_ simply means making separate queries against two or more fact tables where the row
headers of each query consist of identical conformed attributes. The answer sets from the two
queries are aligned by performing a sort-merge operation on the common dimension attribute row
headers. BI tool vendors refer to this functionality by various names, including stitch and multipass

query.

**Value Chain**
A _value chain_ identifies the natural flow of an organization’s primary business processes. For
example, a retailer’s value chain may consist of purchasing to ware- housing to retail sales. A general
ledger value chain may consist of budgeting to commitments to payments. Operational source
systems typically produce transactions or snapshots at each step of the value chain. Because each
process produces unique metrics at unique time intervals with unique granularity and dimensionality,
each process typically spawns at least one atomic fact table.

**Enterprise Data Warehouse Bus Architecture**

The _enterprise data warehouse bus architecture_ provides an incremental approach to building the
enterprise DW/BI system. This architecture decomposes the DW/ BI planning process into
manageable pieces by focusing on business processes, while delivering integration via standardized
conformed dimensions that are reused across processes. It provides an architectural framework,
while also decomposing the program to encourage manageable agile implementations corresponding
to the rows on the enterprise data warehouse bus matrix. The bus architecture is technology and
database platform independent; both relational and OLAP dimensional structures can participate.

<!-- fin de página 13 -->

**Enterprise Data Warehouse Bus Matrix**

The _enterprise data warehouse bus matrix_ is the essential tool for designing and communicating the
enterprise data warehouse bus architecture. The rows of the matrix are business processes and the
columns are dimensions. The shaded cells of the matrix indicate whether a dimension is associated

with a given business process. The design team scans each row to test whether a candidate
dimension is well-defined for the business process and also scans each column to see where a
dimension should be conformed across multiple business processes. Besides the technical design
considerations, the bus matrix is used as input to prioritize DW/BI projects with business
management as teams should implement one row of the matrix at a time.

The _detailed implementation bus matrix_ is a more granular bus matrix where each business process
row has been expanded to show specific fact tables or OLAP cubes. At this level of detail, the precise
grain statement and list of facts can be documented.

**Opportunity/Stakeholder Matrix**
After the enterprise data warehouse bus matrix rows have been identified, you can draft a different
matrix by replacing the dimension columns with business functions, such as marketing, sales, and
finance, and then shading the matrix cells to indicate which business functions are interested in
which business process rows. The _opportunity/stakeholder matrix_ helps identify which business
groups should be invited to the collaborative design sessions for each process-centric row.

## **Slowly Changing Dimension Techniques**

**Type 0: Retain Original**

With slowly changing dimension _type 0_, the dimension attribute value never changes, so facts are
always grouped by this original value. Type 0 is appropriate for any attribute labeled “original,” such
as a customer’s original credit score or a durable identifier. It also applies to most attributes in a date
dimension.

**Type 1: Overwrite**

With slowly changing dimension _type 1_, the old attribute value in the dimension row is overwritten
with the new value; type 1 attributes always reflects the most recent assignment, and therefore this
technique destroys history. Although this approach is easy to implement and does not create
additional dimension rows, you must be careful that aggregate fact tables and OLAP cubes affected
by this change are recomputed.

**Type 2: Add New Row**

Slowly changing dimension _type 2_ changes add a new row in the dimension with the updated
attribute values. This requires generalizing the primary key of the dimension beyond the natural or
durable key because there will potentially be multiple rows describing each member. When a new
row is created for a dimension member, a new primary surrogate key is assigned and used as a
foreign key in all fact tables from the moment of the update until a subsequent change creates a new
dimension key and updated dimension row. A minimum of three additional columns should be added
to the dimension row with type 2 changes: 1) row effective date or date/time stamp; 2) row expiration
date or date/time stamp; and 3) current row indicator.

**Type 3: Add New Attribute**

Slowly changing dimension _type 3_ changes add a new attribute in the dimension to preserve the old
attribute value; the new value overwrites the main attribute as in a type 1 change. This kind of type 3
change is sometimes called an alternate reality. A business user can group and filter fact data by
either the current value or alternate reality. This slowly changing dimension technique is used
relatively infrequently.

**Type 4: Add Mini-Dimension**

Slowly changing dimension _type 4_ is used when a group of attributes in a dimension rapidly changes
and is split off to a _mini-dimension._ This situation is sometimes called a rapidly _changing monster_
_dimension_ . Frequently used attributes in multimillion-row dimension tables are mini-dimension design
candidates, even if they don’t frequently change. The type 4 mini-dimension requires its own unique
primary key; the primary keys of both the base dimension and mini-dimension are captured in the
associated fact tables.

**Type 5: Add Mini-Dimension and Type 1 Outrigger**

Slowly changing dimension _type 5_ is used to accurately preserve historical attribute values, plus
report historical facts according to current attribute values. Type 5 builds on the type 4 minidimension by also embedding a current type 1 reference to the mini-dimension in the base
dimension. This enables the currently-assigned mini- dimension attributes to be accessed along with

<!-- fin de página 15 -->

the others in the base dimension without linking through a fact table. Logically, you’d represent the
base dimension and mini-dimension outrigger as a single table in the presentation area. The ETL
team must overwrite this type 1 mini-dimension reference whenever the current mini-dimension
assignment changes.

**Type 6: Add Type 1 Attributes to Type 2 Dimension**

Like type 5, slowly changing dimension _type 6_ also delivers both historical and current dimension
attribute values. Type 6 builds on the type 2 technique by also embedding current type 1 versions of
the same attributes in the dimension row so that fact rows can be filtered or grouped by either the
type 2 attribute value in effect when the measurement occurred or the attribute’s current value. In this
case, the type 1 attribute is systematically overwritten on all rows associated with a particular durable
key whenever the attribute is updated.

**Type 7: Dual Type 1 and Type 2 Dimensions**
Slowly changing dimension _type 7_ is the final hybrid technique used to support both as-was and as-is
reporting. A fact table can be accessed through a dimension modeled both as a type 1 dimension
showing only the most current attribute values, or as a type 2 dimension showing correct
contemporary historical profiles. The same dimension table enables both perspectives. Both the
durable key and primary surrogate key of the dimension are placed in the fact table. For the type 1
perspective, the current flag in the dimension is constrained to be current, and the fact table is joined
via the durable key. For the type 2 perspective, the current flag is not constrained, and the fact table
is joined via the surrogate primary key. These two perspectives would be deployed as separate views
to the BI applications.

## **Dealing with Dimension Hierarchies**

**Fixed Depth Positional Hierarchies**
A _fixed depth hierarchy_ is a series of many-to-one relationships, such as product to brand to category
to department. When a fixed depth hierarchy is defined and the hierarchy levels have agreed upon
names, the hierarchy levels should appear as separate positional attributes in a dimension table. A
fixed depth hierarchy is by far the easiest to understand and navigate as long as the above criteria
are met. It also delivers predictable and fast query performance. When the hierarchy is not a series of
many-to-one relationships or the number of levels varies such that the levels do not have agreed
upon names, a ragged hierarchy technique must be used.

**Slightly Ragged/Variable Depth Hierarchies**
_Slightly ragged_ hierarchies don’t have a fixed number of levels, but the range in depth is small.
Geographic hierarchies often range in depth from perhaps three levels to six levels. Rather than
using the complex machinery for unpredictably variable hierarchies, you can force-fit slightly ragged
hierarchies into a fixed depth positional design with separate dimension attributes for the maximum
number of levels, and then populate the attribute value based on rules from the business.

**Ragged/Variable Depth Hierarchies**

_Ragged hierarchies_ of indeterminate depth are difficult to model and query in a relational database.
Although SQL extensions and OLAP access languages provide some support for recursive parent/
child relationships, these approaches have limitations. With SQL extensions, alternative ragged
hierarchies cannot be substituted at query time, shared ownership structures are not supported, and
time varying ragged hierarchies are not supported. All these objections can be overcome in relational
databases by modeling a ragged hierarchy with a specially constructed _bridge table_ . This bridge table
contains a row for every possible path in the ragged hierarchy and enables all forms of hierarchy
traversal to be accomplished with standard SQL rather than using special language extensions.

The use of a bridge table for ragged variable depth hierarchies can be avoided by implementing a
_pathstring attribute_ in the dimension. For each row in the dimension, the pathstring attribute contains
a specially encoded text string containing the complete path description from the supreme node of a
hierarchy down to the node described by the particular dimension row. Many of the standard
hierarchy analysis requests can then be handled by standard SQL, without resorting to SQL
language extensions. However, the pathstring approach does not enable rapid substitution of
alternative hierarchies or shared ownership hierarchies. The pathstring approach may also be
vulnerable to structure changes in the ragged hierarchy that could force the entire hierarchy to be
relabeled.

## **Advanced Fact Table Techniques**

**Fact Table Surrogate Keys**

Surrogate keys are used to implement the primary keys of almost all dimension tables. In addition,
single column surrogate fact keys can be useful, albeit not required. _Fact table surrogate keys_, which
are not associated with any dimension, are assigned sequentially during the ETL load process and
are used 1) as the single column primary key of the fact table; 2) to serve as an immediate identifier
of a fact table row without navigating multiple dimensions for ETL purposes; 3) to allow an interrupted
load process to either back out or resume; 4) to allow fact table update operations to be decomposed
into less risky inserts plus deletes.

**Centipede Fact Tables**

Some designers create separate normalized dimensions for each level of a many-to- one hierarchy,
such as a date dimension, month dimension, quarter dimension, and year dimension, and then
include all these foreign keys in a fact table. This results in a _centipede fact table_ with dozens of
hierarchically related dimensions. Centipede fact tables should be avoided. All these fixed depth,
many-to-one hierarchically related dimensions should be collapsed back to their unique lowest
grains, such as the date for the example mentioned. Centipede fact tables also result when designers
embed numerous foreign keys to individual low-cardinality dimension tables rather than creating a
junk dimension.

**Numeric Values as Attributes or Facts**

Designers sometimes encounter numeric values that don’t clearly fall into either the fact or dimension
attribute categories. A classic example is a product’s standard list price. If the numeric value is used
primarily for calculation purposes, it likely belongs in the fact table. If a stable numeric value is used
predominantly for filtering and grouping, it should be treated as a dimension attribute; the discrete
numeric values can be supplemented with value band attributes (such as $0-50). In some cases, it is
useful to model the numeric value as both a fact and dimension attribute, such as a quantitative ontime delivery metric and qualitative textual descriptor.

**Lag/Duration Facts**

Accumulating snapshot fact tables capture multiple process milestones, each with a date foreign key
and possibly a date/time stamp. Business users often want to analyze the lags or durations between
these milestones; sometimes these lags are just the differences between dates, but other times the
lags are based on more complicated business rules. If there are dozens of steps in a pipeline, there
could be hundreds of possible lags. Rather than forcing the user’s query to calculate each possible
lag from the date/time stamps or date dimension foreign keys, just one time lag can be stored for
each step measured against the process’s start point. Then every possible lag between two steps
can be calculated as a simple subtraction between the two lags stored in the fact table.

**Header/Line Fact Tables**

Operational transaction systems often consist of a transaction header row that’s associated with
multiple transaction lines. With _header/line_ schemas (also known as _parent/child_ schemas), all the
header-level dimension foreign keys and degenerate dimensions should be included on the line-level
fact table.

<!-- fin de página 18 -->

**Allocated Facts**

It is quite common in header/line transaction data to encounter facts of differing granularity, such as a
header freight charge. You should strive to _allocate_ the header facts down to the line level based on
rules provided by the business, so the allocated facts can be sliced and rolled up by all the
dimensions. In many cases, you can avoid creating a header-level fact table, unless this aggregation
delivers query performance advantages.

**Profit and Loss Fact Tables Using Allocations**
Fact tables that expose the full equation of _profit_ are among the most powerful deliverables of an
enterprise DW/BI system. The equation of profit is (revenue) – (costs) = (profit). Fact tables ideally
implement the profit equation at the grain of the atomic revenue transaction and contain many
components of cost. Because these tables are at the atomic grain, numerous rollups are possible,
including customer profitability, product profitability, promotion profitability, channel profitability, and
others. However, these fact tables are difficult to build because the cost components must be
allocated from their original sources to the fact table’s grain. This allocation step is often a major ETL
subsystem and is a politically charged step that requires high- level executive support. For these
reasons, profit and loss fact tables are typically not tackled during the early implementation phases of
a DW/BI program.

**Multiple Currency Facts**
Fact tables that record financial transactions in multiple currencies should contain a pair of columns
for every financial fact in the row. One column contains the fact expressed in the true currency of the
transaction, and the other contains the same fact expressed in a single standard currency that is
used throughout the fact table. The standard currency value is created in an ETL process according
to an approved business rule for currency conversion. This fact table also must have a currency
dimension to identify the transaction’s true currency.

**Multiple Units of Measure Facts**

Some business processes require facts to be stated simultaneously in several units of measure. For
example, depending on the perspective of the business user, a supply chain may need to report the
same facts as pallets, ship cases, retail cases, or individual scan units. If the fact table contains a
large number of facts, each of which must be expressed in all units of measure, a convenient
technique is to store the facts once in the table at an agreed standard unit of measure, but also
simultaneously store conversion factors between the standard measure and all the others. This fact
table could be deployed through views to each user constituency, using an appropriate selected
conversion factor. The conversion factors must reside in the underlying fact table row to ensure the
view calculation is simple and correct, while minimizing query complexity.

**Year-to-Date Facts**

Business users often request year-to-date (YTD) values in a fact table. It is hard to argue against a
single request, but YTD requests can easily morph into “YTD at the close of the fiscal period” or
“fiscal period to date.” A more reliable, extensible way to handle these assorted requests is to
calculate the YTD metrics in the BI applications or OLAP cube rather than storing YTD facts in the
fact table.

<!-- fin de página 19 -->

**Multipass SQL to Avoid Fact-to-Fact Table Joins**

A BI application must never issue SQL that joins two fact tables together across the fact table’s
foreign keys. It is impossible to control the cardinality of the answer set of such a join in a relational
database, and incorrect results will be returned to the BI tool. For instance, if two fact tables contain
customer’s product shipments and returns, these two fact tables must not be joined directly across
the customer and product foreign keys. Instead, the technique of drilling across two fact tables should
be used, where the answer sets from shipments and returns are separately created, and the results
sort-merged on the common row header attribute values to produce the correct result.

**Timespan Tracking in Fact Tables**

There are three basic fact table grains: transaction, periodic snapshot, and accumulating snapshot. In
isolated cases, it is useful to add a row effective date, row expiration date, and current row indicator
to the fact table, much like you do with type 2 slowly changing dimensions, to capture a _timespan_
when the fact row was effective. Although an unusual pattern, this pattern addresses scenarios such
as slowly changing inventory balances where a frequent periodic snapshot would load identical rows
with each snapshot.

**Late Arriving Facts**

A fact row is _late arriving_ if the most current dimensional context for new fact rows does not match
the incoming row. This happens when the fact row is delayed. In this case, the relevant dimensions
must be searched to find the dimension keys that were effective when the late arriving measurement
event occurred.

## **Advanced Dimension Table Techniques**

**Dimension-to-Dimension Table Joins**

Dimensions can contain references to other dimensions. Although these relationships can be
modeled with outrigger dimensions, in some cases, the existence of a foreign key to the outrigger
dimension in the base dimension can result in explosive growth of the base dimension because type
2 changes in the outrigger force corresponding type 2 processing in the base dimension. This
explosive growth can often be avoided if you demote the correlation between dimensions by placing
the foreign key of the outrigger in the fact table rather than in the base dimension. This means the
correlation between the dimensions can be discovered only by traversing the fact table, but this may
be acceptable, especially if the fact table is a periodic snapshot where all the keys for all the
dimensions are guaranteed to be present for each reporting period.

**Multivalued Dimensions and Bridge Tables**

In a classic dimensional schema, each dimension attached to a fact table has a single value
consistent with the fact table’s grain. But there are a number of situations in which a dimension is
legitimately _multivalued_ . For example, a patient receiving a healthcare treatment may have multiple
simultaneous diagnoses. In these cases, the multivalued dimension must be attached to the fact
table through a group dimension key to a bridge table with one row for each simultaneous diagnosis
in a group.

A _multivalued bridge table_ may need to be based on a type 2 slowly changing dimension. For
example, the bridge table that implements the many-to-many relationship between bank accounts
and individual customers usually must be based on type 2 account and customer dimensions. In this
case, to prevent incorrect linkages between accounts and customers, the bridge table must include
effective and expiration date/time stamps, and the requesting application must constrain the bridge
table to a specific moment in time to produce a consistent snapshot.

**Behavior Tag Time Series**

Almost all text in a data warehouse is descriptive text in dimension tables. Data mining customer
cluster analyses typically results in textual _behavior tags_, often identified on a periodic basis. In this
case, the customers’ behavior measurements over time become a sequence of these behavior tags;
this time series should be stored as positional attributes in the customer dimension, along with an
optional text string for the complete sequence of tags. The behavior tags are modeled in a positional
design because the behavior tags are the target of complex simultaneous queries rather than
numeric computations.

**Behavior Study Groups**

Complex customer behavior can sometimes be discovered only by running lengthy iterative analyses.
In these cases, it is impractical to embed the behavior analyses inside every BI application that wants
to constrain all the members of the customer dimension who exhibit the complex behavior. The
results of the complex behavior analyses, however, can be captured in a simple table, called a _study_
_group_, consisting only of the customers’ durable keys. This static table can then be used as a kind of
filter on any dimensional schema with a customer dimension by constraining the study group column
to the customer dimension’s durable key in the target schema at query time. Multiple study groups


© Kimball Group. All rights reserved.                                                     Kimball Dimensional Modeling Techniques  18

<!-- fin de página 21 -->

can be defined and derivative study groups can be created with intersections, unions, and set
differences.

**Aggregated Facts as Dimension Attributes**

Business users are often interested in constraining the customer dimension based on aggregated
performance metrics, such as filtering on all customers who spent over a certain dollar amount during
last year or perhaps over the customer’s lifetime. Selected _aggregated facts_ can be placed in a
dimension as targets for constraining and as row labels for reporting. The metrics are often presented
as banded ranges in the dimension table. Dimension attributes representing aggregated performance
metrics add burden to the ETL processing, but ease the analytic burden in the BI layer.

**Dynamic Value Banding**
A _dynamic value banding report_ is organized as a series of report row headers that define a
progressive set of varying-sized ranges of a target numeric fact. For instance, a common value
banding report in a bank has many rows with labels such as “Balance from 0 to $10,” “Balance from
$10.01 to $25,” and so on. This kind of report is dynamic because the specific row headers are
defined at query time, not during the ETL processing. The row definitions can be implemented in a
small value banding dimension table that is joined via greater-than/less-than joins to the fact table, or
the definitions can exist only in an SQL CASE statement. The value banding dimension approach is
probably higher performing, especially in a columnar database, because the CASE statement
approach involves an almost unconstrained relation scan of the fact table.

**Text Comments**

Rather than treating freeform comments as textual metrics in a fact table, they should be stored
outside the fact table in a separate comments dimension (or as attributes in a dimension with one
row per transaction if the comments’ cardinality matches the number of unique transactions) with a
corresponding foreign key in the fact table.

**Multiple Time Zones**

To capture both universal standard time, as well as local times in _multi-time zone_ applications, dual
foreign keys should be placed in the affected fact tables that join to two role-playing date (and
potentially time-of-day) dimension tables.

**Measure Type Dimensions**

Sometimes when a fact table has a long list of facts that is sparsely populated in any individual row, it
is tempting to create a _measure type dimension_ that collapses the fact table row down to a single
generic fact identified by the measure type dimension. We generally do not recommend this
approach. Although it removes all the empty fact columns, it multiplies the size of the fact table by the
average number of occupied columns in each row, and it makes intra-column computations much
more difficult. This technique is acceptable when the number of potential facts is extreme (in the
hundreds), but less than a handful would be applicable to any given fact table row.

**Step Dimensions**

Sequential processes, such as web page events, normally have a separate row in a transaction fact
table for each step in a process. To tell where the individual step fits into the overall session, a _step_


© Kimball Group. All rights reserved.                                                     Kimball Dimensional Modeling Techniques  19

<!-- fin de página 22 -->

_dimension_ is used that shows what step number is represented by the current step and how many
more steps were required to complete the session.

**Hot Swappable Dimensions**

_Hot swappable dimensions_ are used when the same fact table is alternatively paired with different
copies of the same dimension. For example, a single fact table containing stock ticker quotes could
be simultaneously exposed to multiple separate investors, each of whom has unique and proprietary
attributes assigned to different stocks.

**Abstract Generic Dimensions**

Some modelers are attracted to abstract generic dimensions. For example, their schemas include a
single generic location dimension rather than embedded geographic attributes in the store,
warehouse, and customer dimensions. Similarly, their person dimension includes rows for
employees, customers, and vendor contacts because they are all human beings, regardless that
significantly different attributes are collected for each type. Abstract generic dimensions should be
avoided in dimensional models. The attribute sets associated with each type often differ. If the
attributes are common, such as a geographic state, then they should be uniquely labeled to
distinguish a store’s state from a customer’s. Finally, dumping all varieties of locations, people, or
products into a single dimension invariably results in a larger dimension table. Data abstraction may
be appropriate in the operational source system or ETL processing, but it negatively impacts query
performance and legibility in the dimensional model.

**Audit Dimensions**

When a fact table row is created in the ETL back room, it is helpful to create an _audit dimension_
containing the ETL processing metadata known at the time. A simple audit dimension row could
contain one or more basic indicators of data quality, perhaps derived from examining an error event
schema that records data quality violations encountered while processing the data. Other useful audit
dimension attributes could include environment variables describing the versions of ETL code used
to create the fact rows or the ETL process execution time stamps. These environment variables are
especially useful for compliance and auditing purposes because they enable BI tools to drill down to
determine which rows were created with what versions of the ETL software.

**Late Arriving Dimensions**

Sometimes the facts from an operational business process arrive minutes, hours, days, or weeks
before the associated dimension context. For example, in a real-time data delivery situation, an
inventory depletion row may arrive showing the natural key of a customer committing to purchase a
particular product. In a real-time ETL system, this row must be posted to the BI layer, even if the
identity of the customer or product cannot be immediately determined. In these cases, special
dimension rows are created with the unresolved natural keys as attributes. Of course, these
dimension rows must contain generic unknown values for most of the descriptive columns;
presumably the proper dimensional context will follow from the source at a later time. When this
dimensional context is eventually supplied, the placeholder dimension rows are updated with type 1
overwrites. Late arriving dimension data also occurs when retroactive changes are made to type 2
dimension attributes. In this case, a new row needs to be inserted in the dimension table, and then

the associated fact rows must be restated.

## **Special Purpose Schemas**

**Supertype and Subtype Schemas for Heterogeneous Products**

Financial services and other businesses frequently offer a wide variety of products in disparate lines
of business. For example, a retail bank may offer dozens of types of accounts ranging from checking
accounts to mortgages to business loans, but all are examples of an account. Attempts to build a
single, consolidated fact table with the union of all possible facts, linked to dimension tables with all
possible attributes of these divergent products, will fail because there can be hundreds of
incompatible facts and attributes. The solution is to build a single _supertype fact table_ that has the
intersection of the facts from all the account types (along with a supertype dimension table containing
the common attributes), and then systematically build separate fact tables (and associated dimension
tables) for each of the subtypes. _Supertype_ and _subtype_ fact tables are also called _core_ and _custom_
_fact tables._

**Real-Time Fact Tables**

_Real-time fact tables_ need to be updated more frequently than the more traditional nightly batch
process. There are many techniques for supporting this requirement, depending on the capabilities of
the DBMS or OLAP cube used for final deployment to the BI reporting layer. For example, a “hot
partition” can be defined on a fact table that is pinned in physical memory. Aggregations and indexes
are deliberately not built on this partition. Other DBMSs or OLAP cubes may support deferred
updating that allows existing queries to run to completion but then perform the updates.

**Error Event Schemas**

Managing data quality in a data warehouse requires a comprehensive system of data quality screens
or filters that test the data as it flows from the source systems to the BI platform. When a data quality
screen detects an error, this event is recorded in a special dimensional schema that is available only
in the ETL back room. This schema consists of an error event fact table whose grain is the individual
error event and an associated error event detail fact table whose grain is each column in each table
that participates in an error event.
