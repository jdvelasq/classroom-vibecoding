###### A letter from the Co-chairs of the ACM Education Board

Dear Readers

In 2009, Turing award winner Jim Gray spoke of data science as a fourth paradigm of science
(empirical, theoretical, computational and data-driven) arising from and capitalizing on the huge
amount of data that is now available for investigation. The confluence of the availability of data
and increasing sophisticated tools, processes, and algorithms for analysing and drawing
knowledge and insight from data has impacted every area of scientific engagement. It has also
opened up exciting new opportunities for interdisciplinary work across the many fields including
(but certainly not limited to) computer science, mathematics, statistics, and information science
from which it draws foundational knowledge.

For computer science, the emergence of data science offers both tremendous opportunity and
something of a conundrum, as once again the emergence of a new and closely related computing
practice or field raises inevitable questions about whether and how it fits into current postsecondary computer science curricula.

This document represents an effort by the ACM Education Board through the work of the Data
Science Task Force to answer this question. It is an effort to put our own data science house in
order. This document is not, however, an effort to claim ownership or even primacy in data
science. To do so would be to negate the powerful interdisciplinarity that data science makes
possible.

It is our hope that this document will represent a productive step in a conversation that engages
all relevant fields and disciplines. Toward this end, the ACM Education Board wishes to express
our willingness and excitement about participating in future, more expansive and inclusive
conversations regarding the promise and practice of data science.

Chris Stephenson, Co-chair, ACM Education Board
Elizabeth Hawthorne, Co-chair, ACM Education Board

### **Chapter 1: Introduction**

#### **1.1 Task Force Charter**

At the August 2017 ACM Education Council meeting, a task force was formed to explore a
process to add to the _broad, interdisciplinary conversation_ on data science, with an articulation
of the role of _computing discipline-specific contributions_ to this emerging field. Specifically, the
task force would seek to define what the computing/computational contributions are to this new
field, and provide guidance on computing-specific competencies in data science for departments
offering such programs of study at the undergraduate level.

There are many stakeholders in the discussion of data science – these include colleges and
universities that (hope to) offer data science programs, employers who hope to hire a workforce
with knowledge and experience in data science, as well as individuals and professional societies
representing the fields of computing, statistics, machine learning, computational biology,
computational social sciences, digital humanities, and others. There is a shared desire to form a
broad interdisciplinary definition of data science and to develop curriculum guidance for degree
programs in data science.

This volume builds upon the important work of other groups who have published guidelines for
data science education. There is a need to acknowledge the definition and description of the
individual contributions to this interdisciplinary field. For instance, those interested in the
business context for these concepts generally use the term “analytics”; in some cases, the
abbreviation DSA appears, meaning Data Science and Analytics.

This volume is the third draft articulation of computing-focused competencies for data science. It
recognizes the inherent interdisciplinarity of data science and situates computing-specific
competencies within the broader interdisciplinary space.

#### **1.2 Motivating the study of Data Science**

Those who study Data Science have to develop a mind set with a strong focus on data – the
collection of data and, through analysing it appropriately, using this to bring about beneficial
insights and changes. For instance:


 - Obtaining data about the quality of air in a city can result in removing dangerous

pollution or sending warning messages to those who suffer from asthma.


 - Collecting data about traffic in real time can result in steps being taken to avoid traffic

congestion.


 - Collecting patient data can lead to new insights for disease diagnosis and treatment.


 - Recording data about speech in a certain area can assist with speech recognition.

The possibilities are endless, and the contributions that Data Science can make to transforming
businesses, transforming society and basically shaping the future for the better are huge. The
possibilities also carry with them potentially negative consequences.

Students of Data Science need to be imbued with the ‘joy of data,’ seeing data as the ‘currency
or fuel of our time’. They also need to be imbued with a strong sense of professional and ethical
responsibility. Data Science courses ought to reflect such sentiments; likewise, the education of
data scientists.

The topic of careers is of course important from a marketing perspective. Suffice it to say that the
current demand is considerable and growing daily.

#### **1.3 Committee work and processes**

The Data Science Task Force was initiated at a meeting of the ACM Education Council in
August 2017. The Co-chairs were appointed at the meeting and were charged with developing a
charter for the work, as well as assembling a task force with global representation.

The Co-chairs drafted a proposal to create the Task Force, which was approved by the ACM
Education Board in January 2018. The initial Task Force – approximately half of the members of
the current committee – convened for a full-day meeting in February 2018.

In preparation for a second face-to-face meeting in July 2018, the Task Force designed two
surveys to gather input from academia and industry on the computing competencies most central
to Data Science. The results of the survey are presented in this report, with details provided in
Appendix B. During this time, the Co-chairs invited additional members to join the committee
and began to develop a global advisory group.

At the July 2018 meeting, the ACM Task Force developed the set of computing-focused
Knowledge Areas for Data Science that appeared in the first public draft of this project (available
at http://dstf.acm.org/DSReportInitialFull.pdf). With the release of the first draft report, the ACM
Data Science Task Force called for discussion and feedback from all data science constituencies.
They presented the report and gathered comments at conferences and meetings, including
Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI-9), held at AAAI in January 2019; the
SIGCSE Symposium in February 2019; the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences in
May 2019; and the Joint Statistical Meetings in July 2019.

he ACM Data Science Task Force held two additional face-to-face meetings at SIGCSE 2019
and in August 2019. Based on feedback from the community, they (with the help and feedback
of subcommittees) revised the list of Knowledge Areas as well as specified competencies for
those in significantly greater detail than previously.

The second public draft was released in December 2019, requesting comments by March 31,
2020 and released a call for example courses. The report was presented, and feedback solicited,
at virtual conferences and meetings including AMA MathFest in January 2020; the SIGCSE
Symposium in March 2020; and ITiCSE 2020 in July 2020.

**With the release of this report, the ACM Data Science Task Force is calling for discussion**
from all data science constituencies that will lead to a robust and complete curriculum guide with
competencies from all disciplines. To further the efforts towards a complete data science model
curriculum, we recommend creating a multidisciplinary taskforce with representatives from
computing, statistics, mathematics, and other societies.

### **Chapter 2:** **Current View of Data Science** **and Prior Work**

#### **2.1 Interdisciplinarity in Data Science**

Data Science is an inherently interdisciplinary field. The rise of Data Science is directly
connected to the rise of large data sets across nearly every topic domain. The sciences, social
sciences, business, humanities, and engineering all are seeing opportunities for discovery and
decision-making expanded by unprecedented amounts of raw or structured data. The data is too
large to allow effective human analysis without the automation of processes. Data Science is the
field that brings together domain data, computer science, and the statistical tools for interrogating
the data and extracting useful information.

Data Science requires effective integration of a domain to provide data and a context for its
exploration, statistics, and computer science. Domain experts understand their data and perhaps
know what they can expect to learn from the data. They want tools and techniques to get the job
done. They need to know enough about the tools and techniques to be confident that the results
will be reliable.

Statisticians bring expertise in “data analysis, data collection, modeling, and inference.”  [9, p
7]. Statistical models “describe, predict, and explain processes” [9, p 8]. The PCMI Data
Science Guidelines provide a full description of the statistics and mathematical foundations
needed for data science.

Computer scientists bring methods for dependable storage, for protecting privacy, and the
integrity of the data. They bring expertise in applying high performance computing and
networked systems for efficient computation. Algorithms for machine learning and deep
learning techniques allow results that go beyond direct analysis of the existing data and offer
opportunities for discovery that may not be anticipated by the data owners. Computer Science
offers tools for the analysis of data of all types, whether numeric, text, image, sound, or complex
combinations of basic data types.

Each component of the Data Science environment: the **domain** that provides the data; **statistics**
**and mathematics** for analysis, modeling, and inference; and **computer science** for data access,
management, protection, as well as effective processing in modern computer architectures, is
essential. However, a random collection of the three elements does not constitute a meaningful
Data Science program. Data Science is interdisciplinary and requires the effective integration of
the three components to produce meaningful results.


10

<!-- fin de página 11 -->

True interdisciplinary work is challenging. If each component remains independent, the
relationships remain blurred and the opportunities for cross-fertilization are reduced [4]. Some
see interdisciplinary efforts as a reduction in one or more of the component areas. When dealing
with a truly interdisciplinary subject, the goal must be to see the new whole that is composed of
contributions from each part. It is not possible to include everything from every part, but that is
not the point. The point is to define something new that takes important parts from each
contributor.

Early programs in Data Science will often work with a group of existing courses from the
participating disciplines. That is practical and easy to bring a new program into existence. The
difficulty in that scenario is to make the essential connections so that all the parts work together
to support discovery and decision making in the domain. Cross references between courses,
projects that call upon topics learned in other courses, and a comprehensive project to bring all
the pieces together are essential to turn a mixed set of courses into a cohesive, interdisciplinary

program.


11

<!-- fin de página 12 -->

#### **2.2 Prior work on defining data science curricula**

As an inherently interdisciplinary area, data science generates interest within many fields.
Accordingly, there have been a number of Data Science curriculum efforts, each reflecting the
perspective of the organization that created it.

This project looks at data science from the perspective of the computing disciplines, but
recognizes that other views contribute to the full picture. Beyond the curriculum guides from
professional societies for Computer Science [1], Statistical Sciences [2], and Mathematical
Sciences [11], the following examples are especially important, and have informed the
committee’s work.

_**The EDISON Data Science Framework [6,7]**_

EDISON is a project started in September 2015 “with the purpose of accelerating the creation of
the Data Science profession.” The core EDISON consortium consists of seven partners across
Europe. Since 2015, the group has worked to create the EDISON Data Science Framework. This
collection of documents includes a general introduction, as well as four detailed components,
including:


 - Data Science Competences Framework

 - Data Science Body of Knowledge

 - Data Science Model Curriculum

 - Data Science Professional Framework

This comprehensive set of curricular volumes parallels the intended structure of our work.
EDISON was in earlier stages as this project began; at present, it is clear that there are significant
overlaps, it is our intent to create a complementary volume, rather than a replicated or competing
volume.

_**The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine Report on Data Science for**_
_**Undergraduates [8]**_

As the press release announcing the publication of the National Academies report states, “Data
science draws on skills and concepts from a wide array of disciplines that may not always
overlap, making it a truly interdisciplinary field. Students in many fields need to learn about data
collection, storage, integration, analysis, inference, communication, and ethics.” The report
highlights the demand for data scientists and calls for a broad education for students across
programs of study. Identifying many data science roles, including those related to hardware and
software platforms, data storage and access, statistical modelling and machine learning, and
business analytics, among others, the report does not presume that every data scientist will be
expert in all areas, but rather that programs will develop to allow graduates to fulfil specific
roles.


12

<!-- fin de página 13 -->

The intent of the National Academies report was to highlight the importance, breadth, and depth
of data science, and to provide high-level guidance for data science programs. It is not a detailed
curricular volume in the sense of the EDISON project or this ACM Data Science effort.

_**The Park City Report [9]**_

The Park City Math Institute 2016 Summer Undergraduate Faculty Program convened with the
purpose of articulating guidelines for undergraduate programs in Data Science. The three-week
workshop brought together 25 faculty from computer science, statistics and mathematics. The
base assertion of the report and proposed curriculum is that data is the core: “The recursive data
cycle of obtaining, wrangling, curating, managing and processing data, exploring data, defining
questions, performing analyses, and communicating the results lies at the core of the data science
experience.”

The resulting list of key competencies shows the interdisciplinary nature of data science, with an
understandable focus on the mathematics and statistics:


 - Computational and statistical thinking

 - Mathematical foundations

 - Model building and assessment

 - Algorithms and software foundation

 - Data curation

 - Knowledge transference – communication and responsibility

The role of computer science appears in the description of computational thinking: “Data science
graduates should be proficient in many of the foundational software skills and the associated
algorithmic, computational problem solving of the discipline of computer science.” However,
further description relates these skills to understanding the programming and algorithms behind
“professional statistical analysis software tools.”

The Park City report deserves further description. It includes an outline of the Data Science
Major:

1.   Introduction to data science

a.   Introduction to Data Science I

b.   Introduction to Data Science II

2.   Mathematical foundations

a.   Mathematics for Data Science I

b.   Mathematics for Data Science II
3.   Computational thinking
a.   Algorithms and Software Foundations
b.   Data Curation—Databases and Data Management
4.   Statistical thinking
a.   Introduction to Statistical Models
b.   Statistical and Machine Learning
5.   Course in an outside discipline


13

<!-- fin de página 14 -->

The report also includes a description of each of the courses. For the purposes of this report, it is
noted that programming is introduced in Introduction to Data Science I and II, and appears again
as a part of Algorithms and Software Foundations. The course in Data Curation includes
traditional databases as well as newer approaches to data storage and interaction. The course in
Statistical and Machine Learning “blends the algorithmic perspective of machine learning in
computer science and the predictive perspective of statistical thinking.”

Although there certainly are additional aspects of computer science that are relevant to the
preparation of a student of data science, there is clearly an effort to combine the mathematical
and computer science contributions to produce a blended program. This ACM Data Science
report builds on the Park City work with a heavy orientation toward computer science. The
position of the Task Force is that any Data Science program will have to reflect competencies in
mathematics, statistics, and computer science, possibly with different emphases. This is
consistent with the view of the National Academies report. Graduates of programs following the
Park City guidelines will have valuable strengths and graduates of programs following these
ACM guidelines will have different, but equally valuable strengths.

_**The Business Higher Education Framework (BHEF) Data Science and Analytics (DSA)**_
_**Competency Map [5]**_

The work provides a four-level competency map. The base, or Tier 1, level describes personal
effectiveness competencies. These are not considered competencies learned in school, but rather
part of an individual’s personal development. Examples include integrity, initiative,
dependability, adaptability, professionalism, teamwork, interpersonal communication, and
respect.

Tier 2 describes academic competencies to be acquired in higher education. These are most
relevant to this report and include the following:


 - Deriving value from data

 - Data Literacy

 - Data Governance and Ethics

 - Technology

 - Programming and Data Management

 - Analytic Planning

 - Analytics

 - Communication

Tier 3 presents workplace competencies: planning and organizing, problem solving, decisionmaking, business fundamentals, customer focus, and working with tools and technology.

Tier 4 is for Industry-Wide Technical Competencies. These are not specified, but represent skills
that are common across sectors of a larger industry context.


14

<!-- fin de página 15 -->

Though Tier 2 includes a competency in “Programming and Data Management,” the description
mentions only “Write data analysis code using modern statistical software (e.g., R, Python, and
SAS).” This set of competencies does not address a need for developing new software or
systems in support of data science, but relies on available tools.

_**Business Analytics Curriculum for Undergraduate Majors [10]**_

This report was produced in 2015 by the Institute for Operations Research and the Management
Sciences (INFORMS). Reflecting the focus of programs in Business, this INFORMS curriculum
assumes basic computer literacy as a starting point. It suggests revising some of the standard
courses in statistics to meet newer needs. The resulting course list includes: Data Management,
Descriptive Analytics, Data Visualization, Predictive Analytics, Prescriptive Analytics, Data
Mining, and Analytics Practicum. It also includes electives.

Like the guidelines from the Business Higher Education Framework, the focus is on doing
something with data, primarily to serve business needs. There is no mention of programming.
The data management course includes SQL, but has no prerequisites. The emphasis in the data
mining course is on framing a business problem. Data mining techniques are compared, and
large datasets are to be used. The tools to be used for that purpose are not specified.

_**Initial workshops related to this ACM Data Science Curriculum effort [3]**_

In October 2015, the National Science Foundation sponsored a workshop with representatives of
many perspectives on data science. Some attendees represented established programs, others
represented societies with an interest in data science. The final report, “Strengthening Data
Science Education Through Collaboration,” describes the discussions and reflects the diversity of
opinions. Although opinions varied, there were some areas of agreement. Those form the basis
of the list of Knowledge Areas in this current ACM report.

_**Summary**_

The review of existing curricular efforts suggests that it would be important to capture in a single
volume the contributions that computing makes to data science. Through developments such as
the Internet of Things, sophisticated sensors, face recognition and voice recognition, automation,
etc., computing opens up many avenues for data collection. It can play a vital role as a custodian
of information with great attention being paid to maintenance but crucially also to security and
confidentiality matters. Then the analysis of large amounts of information and utilization of that
for the purposes of machine learning or augmented intelligence in its various roles can bring
significant benefit.

#### **2.3 Survey of academic and industry representatives**

In order to gain an understanding of the current data science landscape, the ACM Data Science
Task Force, in early 2018 we conducted a survey of ACM members, representing academic
institutions and industry organizations. Through outreach to ACM members, the Task Force was
also able to reach computing professionals outside of ACM membership. In all cases, the Task
Force sought global participation. There were 672 responses to the academic survey and 297
responses to the industry survey.

_**Academic Survey**_

The academic survey asked academics whether their institution had any sort of data science
program at the undergraduate level, asked what type of program was offered, in what
department(s) it was housed, and what computing areas were required, elective, or not present in
the program. It also allowed respondents to add to the list of computing areas specified in the
survey. Finally, the survey asked participants whether their data science program had a “data
science in context” requirement – i.e., a requirement that students apply data science to another

area.

Nearly half of respondents from academic institutions (47%) reported they did not offer an
undergraduate data science program. However, over half of those who reported offering some
type of program offered a full bachelor’s degree in data science.

Nearly all of the programs offering a bachelor’s degree in data science required courses in
programming skills and statistics. In addition, the majority of programs also required data
management principles, probability, data structures and algorithms, data visualisation, data
mining, and machine learning. Other courses included topics such as ethics, calculus, discrete
mathematics and linear algebra. We note that a majority of programs also required a “data
science in context” course.

Administratively, the largest percentage of programs were housed in a computer science
department; however, almost as many were in an “other” category. This result might be
somewhat skewed, given that the survey was fielded primarily with ACM members.

Additionally, over half of these programs reported graduating 10 students or less annually.

We expect that the number of Data Science programs will increase, as will the number of
students choosing to study it. This, then, is an ideal time to articulate computing-based
competencies for those programs.

_**Industry Survey**_

The industry survey roughly mirrored the academic survey; however, the primary question was
whether a company looked for job applicants with data science experience and what computing
experience they required or preferred those applicants to have.


16

<!-- fin de página 17 -->

In the survey of industry representatives, nearly half (48%) responded that they look for
candidates specifically with data science or analytics degrees or educational backgrounds.
We found it particularly interesting that the majority of employers reported these employees
work as individual contributors on data science tasks.

Industry respondents reported requiring experience or skills in similar areas to those required by
college or university Data Science programs. One slight difference is that employers reported
requiring more computing skills than statistical or mathematical skills.

_**Other Observations**_

The ACM Task Force was somewhat surprised by certain survey results. For instance, industry
respondents did not report data security and privacy as a required competency area for job
applicants. We note that this may reflect employers’ understanding of what Data Science (and
Computer Science) programs are requiring of their majors. That is, it might reflect the reality of
the applicant pool, rather than a “wish list” of competencies.

Similarly, we note that academic institutions reported what they currently require, rather than
what they would require in an ideal world. This might, in some cases, reflect the availability of
courses and faculty at an institution, rather than a “gold standard” for Data Science programs.

A more detailed summary of survey results is presented in Appendix B.

### **Chapter 3:** **Introduction to the Body of Knowledge**

#### **3.1 Knowledge Areas**

Following the work of previous ACM curricular volumes (see [1], for instance), this report is
organized around Knowledge Areas (KAs). The KAs identified for the first draft of this report
(released in January 2019) were based on survey input (see Section 2.3) as well as prior work,
with special attention being given to the results of the workshop reported in [5].

Feedback on the first draft prompted the Task Force to revise the list of KAs. The core
computing discipline-specific Knowledge Areas for Data Science described in this (second) draft
are (in alphabetical order):


 - Analysis and Presentation (AP)

 - Artificial Intelligence (AI)

 - Big Data Systems (BDS)

 - Computing and Computer Fundamentals (CCF)

 - Data Acquisition, Management, and Governance (DG)

 - Data Mining (DM)

 - Data Privacy, Security, Integrity, and Analysis for Security (DP)

 - Machine Learning (ML)

 - Professionalism (PR)

 - Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms (PDA)

 - Software Development and Maintenance (SDM)

For a full curriculum the above KAs need to be augmented with competencies in calculus,
discrete structures, probability theory, elementary statistics, advanced topics in statistics, and
linear algebra, among others. A complete curriculum would also include at least one domain
context for application of Data Science concepts and methods.

#### **3.2 The Competency Framework**

The Competency Framework provides a framework for the description of the various Knowledge
Areas.

In deciding on a competency framework, the Data Science Task Force looked to other ACM
curricular volumes for guidance. In particular the 2013 ACM Computer Science volume ([1])
and Chapter 4 on Competencies in the IT 2017 ([6]) volume received significant attention. The
notion of Knowledge Areas was present in both as was the notion of competence. The IT 2017
volume had introduced the notion of _disposition_, a concept that had its origins in [3], as well as
the concept of _context_ to highlight distinctive situations; both of these featured in the thinking of
the Task Force.

In the final analysis, it was decided to adopt a competency framework that best suited the Task
Force who had been charged with providing curricular guidance in the new area of Data Science.
There was a wish to have some latitude in approach so as to be able to convey their thinking and
permit an appropriate focus on the discipline and its implementation.

_**The Framework**_

In broad outline, the framework takes the form of a set of Knowledge Areas, each Knowledge
Area representing a significant and coherent body of material to be included in Data Science
degree programs. Knowledge areas provide a vocabulary of terms that the community will use
and focus on in discussion about Data Science. They capture concepts that are significant and
central to the discipline. The definition of these should be as self-contained as possible to reflect
their central role.

Each Knowledge Area description follows a template. (See Figure 3-1) To amplify:


 - Following the name of the Knowledge Area, there will be a relatively brief paragraph

describing the area and its relevance in Data Science

 - A section addressing the scope of the Knowledge Area as it applies to Data Science

 - A section capturing very high-level competencies, skills as well as dispositions

 - A list of sub-domains, and finally

 - The definitions of the listed sub-domains

The Knowledge Areas themselves are further refined into a set of sub-domains, each of these
being defined by associated competencies. See Figure 3-2 at the end of this chapter for a list of
Knowledge Areas and the accompanying sub-domains.

_**Sub-domains**_

In describing and defining the sub-domains, the initial text is intended to draw attention to the
relevance of the topic within Data Science, bearing in mind that the overall report is to capture
the study of Data Science at the undergraduate level in the areas related to computer science.
This is followed by sections addressing knowledge, skills, dispositions and context.


20

<!-- fin de página 21 -->

The knowledge section takes the form of a bulleted list of major topics or topic areas within the
sub-domain.

The skills section is a bulleted list of skills to be acquired during study of the sub-domain.
Naturally this tends to reference the knowledge items within that sub-domain.

Skills are expressed in terms of learning outcomes (LOs). Formally, a learning outcome captures
an aspect of what a student is expected to accomplish through study of particular topics.

|Sub-domains|Sub-domains|
|List sub-domains here|List additional sub-domains here|


Figure 3-1 Template for Knowledge Area definitions

The various sub-domains are then addressed in order. For each sub-domain, the sub-domain name is
followed by an optional brief paragraph describing the sub-domain and then


  - A list of knowledge topics

  - A list of skills

  - An optional list of dispositions, and finally

  - An optional context section

Likewise, for the other sub-domains.


21

<!-- fin de página 22 -->

LOs have their origins in Bloom’s taxonomy. This was originally developed in 1956 and has
been the subject of much study and development over the years. See, for example, [5] which is a
significant development and forms the basis of the approach used here; throughout, the Task
Force has placed an emphasis on capturing aspects of the discipline of Data Science rather than
always ensuring strict adherence to the framework.

Basically, a set of cognitive processes is identified, namely to _remember, understand, apply,_
_analyze, evaluate and create._ These cognitive processes are seen to be of increasing cognitive
challenge, though the precise challenge owes much to the context (as defined by the set of topics
to which it applies) as well as the background of a student. Students can demonstrate a particular
cognitive skill in various ways. Table 3-1 – which owes much to [2, 4] - gives a list of verbs that
illustrate how achievement of a particular cognitive process can be demonstrated; within the list
there are some illustrations of use. The list of verbs should be regarded as indicative and not
exhaustive.

The various learning outcomes then vary in terms of the level of challenge they represent.
Moreover, the number of curriculum hours involved in achieving an LO can also vary. For a
degree program in higher education, it would be expected that the higher-level cognitive
processes feature in some of the LOs.

_**Additional Features of sub-domains**_

_On the T1, T2, E designations_

The three designations T1, T2 and E have been used and are associated with the various
knowledge, skills, and dispositions. In brief


 - T1 (Tier 1) denotes an item that all Data Science graduates should have mastered

 - T2 (Tier 2) denotes an item that most Data Science graduates would be expected to have

mastered. Any given Data Science graduate would be expected to have mastered a
majority of T2 items.

 - E (Elective) signifies an item that, although important, could reasonably be regarded as

forming part of an elective

These designations may appear at different levels of granularity


 - When placed at the level of a sub-domain, a designation applies to all items within that

sub-domain

 - Otherwise, the designation applies at the item level

The Data Science Task Force recognizes that it is unreasonable to expect all T2 topics to be
accommodated within the one program. This issue is further developed in Chapter 4 of this
document, which addresses (at a high level) building a complete major curriculum. These three
designations are intended to offer guidance on the possible selection of topics for a newly
designed Data Science program, facilitating, for instance, placing an emphasis on the statistical
elements or the cognitive elements that support machine learning and/or artificial intelligence.

_On dispositions_

The concept of _disposition_ arose in [3]. To quote:


_The dispositions and pre-dispositions category arose from an attempt to capture_
_the “areas of values, motivations, feelings, stereotypes and attitudes” applicable_
_to computational thinking._
_These included:_


   - _Confidence in dealing with complexity_

   - _Persistence in working with difficult problems_

   - _The ability to handle ambiguity_

   - _The ability to deal with open-ended problems_


23

<!-- fin de página 24 -->

   - _Setting aside differences to work with others to achieve a common_

_goal or solution, and_

   - _Knowing one's strengths and weaknesses when working with others._


This concept was further amplified in [6] where it states that


_Dispositions encompass socio-emotional skills, behaviours, and attitudes that_
_characterise the inclination to carry out tasks and the sensitivity to know when_
_and how to engage in these tasks […]. To distinguish dispositions from knowledge_
_and skills, [..], a disposition “concerns not what abilities people have, but how_
_people are disposed to use these abilities.”_

In utilising dispositions, the Task Force followed the approach adopted in [7]. See Table
3-2 that relies very heavily on that report.


_**Disposition**_ _**Elaboration**_

Proactive: With initiative, self-starter, independent
Self-directed: Self-motivated, determination, independent
Passionate: Conviction, strong commitment, compelling
Purpose-driven: Goal driven, achieve goals, business acumen
Professional: Professionalism, discretion, ethical, astute
Responsible: Use judgement, discretion, act appropriately
Adaptable: Flexible; agile, adjust in response to change
Collaborative: Team player, willing to work with others
Responsive: Respectful; react quickly and positively
Meticulous: Attentive to detail; thoroughness, accurate
Inventive: Exploratory. Look beyond simple solutions

Table 3-2 Dispositions from CC2020

_On the context sections_

An optional context section is used to draw attention to aspects of sub-domains that may vary
depending on the environment, such as the geographical location (where laws and culture may
vary).

### **Chapter 4:** **Building a Program from Curricular** **Recommendations**

Borrowing heavily from the Computer Science 2013 volume [1]:

_As useful as the Body of Knowledge is, it is important to complement it with a thoughtful_
_understanding of cross-cutting themes in a curriculum, the “big ideas” of [Data Science]. In_
_designing a curriculum, it is also valuable to identify curriculum-wide objectives, for which the_
_Principles and the Characteristics of Graduates chapter of this volume should prove useful._

These observations are highly relevant in the context of this present report. How are they to be
interpreted? Data scientists have to behave ethically, seeing opportunity and benefit in
employing the methods and techniques of the discipline to analyze and derive new information
from data. The methods and techniques have their origins in the basic disciplines of computer
science, mathematics, statistics and machine learning reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the
discipline which, in given situations, may be complemented by application domain knowledge.
Ethics, practical skills, recognizing the potential of data, assembling high quality data, and
seeking new knowledge from that data to bring benefit must underpin the philosophy and ethos
of a program in data science.

In designing a Data Science program these matters need to be captured in a high-level
description of the expected outcomes of the program, or more formally in a specification phrased
in terms of the expected learning outcomes from study of the program. Since Data Science is an
emerging discipline, it is to be expected that the curriculum will be revised regularly. Thought
needs to be given to the implications of that. But there are other considerations that also need to
be taken into account.

#### **4.1 Program design considerations**

Aspects of the nature of degree programs are often determined by national or by institution wide
considerations. Below two particular cases are highlighted. But study programs throughout the
world - for instance, in Australia / New Zealand, Canada, China and South America, tend to be a
variant on these, though in some countries, e.g. Australia or South Africa, it is often possible to
register for a program that provides two qualifications.

_Higher Education in the US_

A rich range of educational possibilities exists with large engineering schools, large researchoriented schools, as well as liberal arts colleges, community colleges, and many others.
Typically, Bachelor’s degree programs are 4 years in duration. In many institutions, students


27

<!-- fin de página 28 -->

have the chance to explore options especially in the early years. In the later years they have the
possibility to touch on topics that border on research. As well as these majors, the system also
accommodates liberal arts degrees as well as minors, which can be taken in conjunction with
study of another discipline.

Possibilities for study abroad may exist and typically occur during the third year. Efforts have to
be made to match the curricula in the home and abroad institutions so that students genuinely
benefit and are not disadvantaged when they return to their home institution.

Another common feature is to allow students to undertake internships in industry. These may be
of 6 months duration but may also last for the full year (and this may extend the duration of the
degree program). These need to be carefully planned. The experience of the students should
contribute significantly to the student’s knowledge and understanding of Data Science and the
institution should ensure that proper quality checks are in place as a safeguard. Variants of this
do exist, e.g. in the UK in the form of Graduate Apprenticeships, where there is a deeper bond
with industry that involves a partnership throughout the entire study program.

_The European Scene_

The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) is “a group of 48 countries that cooperate to
achieve comparable and compatible higher education systems throughout Europe” [2]. This is to
facilitate student as well as staff mobility between EHEA countries with a view to facilitating
employment. The system is underpinned by the Bologna process [3]. This is characterized by
three cycles: the first is a Bachelor’s degree cycle lasting 3 years; the second is a Masters cycle
lasting a further 2 years; and the third is for Doctorate degrees and lasts an additional 3 years.
The Bologna system includes a qualifications framework, a system of credits and quality
assurance. The European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) stipulates, for instance, that 90 credits
is the typical number of credits per year.

Despite the Bologna framework, there are differences in achievement across the various
countries brought about by considerations such as the differing outputs from the school systems.

_**On detailed curricula**_

In terms of detailed curricula, a wide variety of possibilities exists, even beyond the
considerations mentioned above about program structures. For instance, a program can reflect
different emphases on computing, statistics, machine learning, mathematics, or a particular
discipline of application outside of those.

Data Science is a new discipline, not always well understood by students nor by their parents /
advisors. It is desirable that, in the early stages (e.g. the first semester), an initial course - with a
title such as _An Introduction to Data Science_ – should be provided to enthuse students and even
attract additional students to the discipline. A significant premium should be placed on
motivation and conveying the philosophy as well as the real achievements of the discipline; the
course might be designed so that it is available to a wide cross section of the student community.


28

<!-- fin de página 29 -->

It is natural to expect that classes in the early stages of a degree program reflect the basis of
computer science, statistics, mathematics and machine learning. However, certainly in the later
phases, and even relatively early in the program, all the classes ought to have a distinctive Data
Science flavor to reflect and promote the character of this emerging discipline. In the later
phases of the program, possibilities ought to exist allowing students to explore different options
and possibilities, perhaps driven by career ambitions or research leanings.

Most material in the compulsory classes should be T1 / T2 material, though the possibility
should exist for particular expertise in an institution infusing the curriculum. For optional /
elective classes in the later years, the material should be T2 / E. A major project in the final year
(that demonstrates a student’s ability to solve a significant Data Science problem by pulling
together material from several classes) should fall into the E category.

As a final important comment, generally Data Science programs should exist in an environment
where there is encouragement as well as incentives and rewards for exceptional performance.

#### **4.2 Data Science in context**

In addition to developing foundational skills in computing and statistics, data science students
should also learn to apply those skills to real applications. It is important for data science
education to incorporate real data used in an appropriate context.
Data Science curricula should include courses designed to promote dual coverage combining
both data science fundamentals and applications, exploring why people turn to data to explain
contextual phenomena. Such courses highlight how valuable context is in data analytics; where
data are viewed with narratives, and questions often arise about ethics and bias.  It can be
beneficial to teach some courses with a disciplinary context so that students appreciate that data
science is not an abstract set of approaches. Related application disciplines might include
physics, biology, chemistry, the humanities, or other areas.
_**Exemplar courses and programs**_
Although there are a great variety of possible course possibilities, the above comments have been
generic in nature. The next (final) draft of this document will include exemplar courses and
programs that institutions may adopt or adapt for their local settings.

### **Chapter 5: Broadening Participation**

#### **5.1 Overview**

Data Science (DS) is a new field with roots in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science
(CS) and applications to multiple fields. The fact that it is an emerging discipline provides an
opportunity for diversity and inclusion; we should ensure from its inception that there is broad
representation of students who are welcome and persist to graduation and beyond. The fields
most closely aligned to DS are also fields with relatively unbalanced representation of various
groups, including, for example, women racial minorities, students with disabilities, and others.
Data Science can learn from these degree programs’ successes and failures.

Consider the following examples of disparity in fields frequently associated with Data Science.
In the U.S. women represent 57% [7] and underrepresented minorities (URMs) [1] represent 25%

[5] of all Bachelor's recipients in the U.S., but only 19.5% and 12.6% of CS graduates,
respectively [4]. According to the National Science Board _Science and Engineering Indicators_
_2018_ [4], the gender disparity is true for both 2-year and 4-year degree programs in the U.S.
According to EuroStat [8], a website of the European Union, over 1.3 million people were
enrolled in the field of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in the European
Union (EU) in 2016. Females were largely in a minority, accounting for only one in six ICT
students (16.7%). The data for gender representation are somewhat better for Australia, although
they still have lower than 35% female enrolment in CS. And Australia, like many nations, is
grappling with disparities among other groups. Samaras [17] notes that “as social, economic, and
political opportunity becomes increasingly wedded to ICT access in the information society,
Indigenous digital disadvantage threatens to perpetuate or exacerbate the existing inequalities
constraining access.


This report is not the first to identify the emergence of Data Science as an opportunity to reverse
the problem of imbalance observed in the fields from which DS has grown. Excellent work and
recommendations for ensuring broad participation in Data Science exist. As stated in the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) report, _Envisioning the data_
_science discipline: the undergraduate perspective_ [12], the Data Science community has an
opportunity to build DS curriculum to be welcoming and inclusive from the start. As such, Data
Science, as a discipline, should take the best practices for broadening participation from
Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science as well as successes from countries that have
more balanced representation. One of four key recommendations in the NAS report is proactive
and intentional collaboration on Data Science curricula and broadening participation between
two- and four-year institutions. Another key recommendation is to require assessment metrics
for inclusion in the overall assessment of Data Science programs.


1 URMs in CS include all U.S. minorities except Asian Americans who are well represented.

The AAAS report _Levers for Change: An assessment of progress on changing STEM instruction_

[1] discusses problems common to both Mathematics and Computer Science including the lack
of support for using evidence-based teaching techniques, dearth of information on inclusion of
Lesbian, Gay, and Transgendered students, and continued underrepresentation of Hispanics,
African Americans and students from lower socio-economic homes. AAAS recommends support
for faculty to use evidence-based instruction, providing more role models, acknowledging and
confronting implicit bias, and reducing stereotype threat classes.

For students with disabilities, the problems are different. Many tools in Data Science today are
not accessible to such students. For example, screen reader technologies often do not read the
raw pixels of a chart or graph out loud for students that are blind or visually impaired. Videos
created on math or statistics often lack closed-captioning or sign language interpretation, or other
issues like lack of compatibility with the WCAG 2.1 AA standard. These technical issues are not
merely glitches that need to be fixed. They can fundamentally block students with disabilities
from participating in data science at all [19].


The South Big Data Hub’s _Keeping Data Science Broad: Negotiating the Digital & Data Divide_
report [15] includes ten asks for the community, including the following that directly impact
curriculum: Foster partnerships between different institutional types; Provide flexible pathways
into data science education; Time & space to discuss collaboration; Hiring female faculty,
faculty of color, and female faculty of color; and Provide examples of curriculum for 2-year
college degrees, certificates or pathways.

The ACM Data Science Task Force is focusing on undergraduate curriculum; however, it is
equally important for data science industry professionals and graduate programs to embrace the
goal of broadening participation by ensuring fair and inclusive work environments. In K-12,
where laws like the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act require any course to be fully
accessible, broadening participation to be inclusive is both an ethical, and a legal, requirement

[22, 23].

#### **5.2 Benefits of Broadening Participation**

A major argument for broadening participation in computing has been the shortage of computer
scientists, whereby recruiting and retaining women and other underrepresented groups would
help fill worker shortages. Similarly, shortages in the data science workforce are anticipated.
According to [18], based on a survey of the data analysis department of China’s commercial
commission, the gap between the need for and supply of basic data analysis talent exceeds
14,000,000. According to a report by the European Commission in 2017 [9] the EU was
forecasted to face a data skills gap corresponding to 769,000 unfilled positions by 2020. And

[20] reports that the data scientist role will become increasingly important in all industries.
Therefore, the argument for filling worker shortages applies here, however the value of ensuring
inclusion of women and other underrepresented groups goes beyond having a ready and ample
workforce.


31

<!-- fin de página 32 -->

As studies have repeatedly demonstrated, diverse teams are smarter; they focus more on facts,
process facts more carefully, and are more innovative [16]. The National Council for Women &
Information Technology (NCWIT)’s “ _What is the Impact of Gender Diversity on Technology_
_Business Performance: Research Summary_ ” [2] summarizes research studies and identifies key
findings of benefits and costs of diverse teams. Diversity is a prudent financial decision.
Gender-balanced companies perform better financially, particularly when women occupy a
significant proportion of top management positions. Furthermore, gender-balanced teams
improve team productivity. Teams that are more diverse adhere to project schedules in various
technology companies, share knowledge and have lower project costs than homogeneous teams.

Intentional inclusion and diversity are necessary to reduce societal bias as data science continues
to be used for decision making from health care to hiring decisions. News articles are published
regularly (e.g., 43 articles in Google News with the terms “bias Artificial Intelligence” on
12/13/2019) either discussing or highlighting bias in machine learning algorithms. Propagation
of societal biases should be anathema to Data Science. We do not claim that only
underrepresented individuals can grapple with these issues, but as the data presented above
demonstrate, diverse teams with members of many different backgrounds are smarter.

Data Science should be open to all. Data Science jobs, like computing and statistics jobs, pay
high salaries – according to [10], the average data scientist earns $121,189 in the U.S. – and the
field should be open to all, independent of class, race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity,
ethnicity and other factors that do not influence one’s ability to succeed in the field. If not, we
are faced with an issue of social equity.

#### **5.3 Recommendations**

_Data Science programs should report student and faculty demographics as part of_
_assessment._

The NAS report [12] recommends that assessment of diversity be part of all Data Science
programs. This is paramount to ensuring Data Science does not repeat inequities that exist in
other STEM programs. Data Science programs should monitor and report on enrollment and
graduation rates by gender, race, national origin, socio-economic, and disability status.

Assessment reporting should include demographics for faculty as well, and include recruitment
activities in support of diverse faculty. The composition of Data Science faculty must be
considered as part of a holistic approach to broadening participation. The value of a diverse team
is argued above, and this also applies to faculty. In addition, diversity and inclusion is improved
for student populations when students experience diverse faculty and learn in an inclusive
setting. Ponjuan [14], for example, reports on the positive impacts on Latino students when
Latino faculty are present. Therefore, Data Science programs should incorporate best practices in
hiring to ensure a diverse group of faculty. This requires intentional outreach to
underrepresented faculty at research conferences and conferences for underrepresented groups.

techniques for welcoming new faculty. [2] Once hired, it is even more important to provide a
welcoming and supportive work environment for all faculty. NCWIT has a number of references
for recruiting and retaining females in technology, developing male allies, and having strong
mentoring programs.  References include evidence-based guidelines (e.g., NCWIT Tips: 13 Tips
for Creating and Sustaining a Women in Computing Group on Your Campus), promotional
materials for students (e.g., Which computing path is right for me?) and relevant research (e.g.,
Results of a Large-Scale, Multi-Institutional Study of Undergraduate Retention in Computing).
Materials are available at https://www.ncwit.org/resources.

_Data Science course content should be designed to support a diverse student body._
_Faculty, trained in inclusive and diverse teaching pedagogy, should implement these_
_methods to support all recruited students._

“Inclusive pedagogy at its core is learner-centered and equity-focused, creating an overarching
learning environment in which students feel equally invited and included. Drawing from a large
body of research—much of it foundational scholarship on teaching and learning—it is clear
that learning outcomes are improved for everyone when teachers attend to student differences
and take deliberate steps to ensure that all students, across differences […] feel welcomed,
valued, challenged, and supported in their academic work.” [6] Data Science faculty – indeed, all
faculty, should learn about inclusive pedagogy, and what it means for tools to be accessible or
not, and put such techniques into practice.

Many resources provide guidance on inclusive pedagogy [3]. The National Center for Women &
Information Technology (ncwit.org) provides resources for recruiting and retaining women, and
The American Association for Advancement of Science _Levers for Change: An Assessment on_
_Changing STEM Instruction_ also provides recommendations [1]. Additionally, the ACM Special
Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) has published significant work to
improve diversity and inclusion, as have publications from Research on Equity & Sustained
Participation in Engineering, Computing, & Technology (RESPECT).

_Promotion and review criteria should incorporate evaluation of evidence-based_
_inclusive teaching practices._

Providing professional development is not enough to ensure that effective teaching practices are
maintained [1]. Therefore, it is important to devise promotion and review criteria that reward
faculty for sustained implementation of inclusive teaching.

_Data Science programs should include sustained funding for faculty development in_
_teaching._

https://www.ncwit.org/resources/ncwit-tips-7-tips-conducting-inclusive-faculty-searches/ncwit-tips-7-tipsconducting

<!-- fin de página 34 -->

So that faculty may learn and continue to develop best practices in teaching, Data Science
programs should provide the funding necessary for this.

_Intentional collaboration between 2-year and 4-year post-secondary colleges and_
_universities._

Community colleges in the U.S. enroll, on average, a diverse student body. This creates an
opportunity, then, to recruit diverse students to Data Science. Efforts should be taken to create
2+2 pathways for Community College students who wish to pursue an A.S. followed by a B.S. in
Data Science. As noted by Lyon and Denner [11], Community College faculty should be
partners on 4-year advisory boards to ensure that students transferring from community college
have a smooth, and clear, pathway to a bachelor’s degree.

Similar collaboration should be initiated at analogous institutions, where they exist, across the
globe.

Tools and Curricula used should be accessible to people with disabilities. For students with
disabilities to participate meaningfully and equally with data science, several requirements must
be met. First, we recommend all web content meet, as a minimum bar, WCAG 2.1 AA
guidelines for accessibility on the web [21]. At a high-level, this includes captioning videos,
including alternate descriptions for images, and carefully formatting the HTML source code to
meet other WCAG requirements. We imagine that this applies especially to any tools run on the
web and perhaps especially any curricular materials.

Second, many data science tools are not accessible today. We recommend that practitioners
should choose to use data science tools that, at a minimum, are fully compatible with screen
reading technologies, should have keyboard affordances and not just use the mouse, that have
meaningful and easily remembered designs and naming conventions, and that use captions
appropriately. This is not a complete list, as many other technologies exist, but these
recommendations encompass a variety of disability groups. We finally note that it is important to
understand that many of these requirements, like screen readers, may sound like they apply to
only one group (e.g., the blind), but in fact many disability groups rely on the same underpinning
technology. For example, students with motor impairments, blind users, and those with learning
disabilities, all use similar affordances. Operating systems like Microsoft Windows create
support for all people with disabilities in one library, not separate ones for each kind of person.
As such, a data science tool that breaks support for students or professionals with one disability
may in fact not work correctly for all students with disabilities.

### **Chapter 6:** **Characteristics of Data Science** **Graduates**

Graduates of Data Science (DS) programs should have fundamental competency in all areas
described by the Body of Knowledge. However, there are also competencies that graduates of
DS programs should have that are not explicitly listed in the Body of Knowledge.

Data Science graduates should have an appreciation and knowledge of foundational work in
Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, and other applied domain areas contributing to Data
Science. Data Science graduates should be aware that while DS is a new discipline, it is founded
on powerful mathematical, statistical, and computing foundations and approaches. When faced
with a new problem, they can and should draw upon existing techniques when appropriate.
Below, we describe the characteristics that we believe should be attained at least at an
elementary level by graduates of Data Science programs. These characteristics will enable their
success in the field and further professional development. Some of these characteristics and skills
also apply to other computing fields. They are included here because the development of these
skills and characteristics should be explicitly addressed and encouraged by Data Science

programs.

_**Preparation in basic mathematical, statistical, and computing skills:**_

Data Science graduates should have acquired some basic education in computing (programming,
databases, use of the Internet); be able to program on their own with one or two common
languages (Python, R); be aware of some common libraries such as sklearn in Python, R
packages, and several method or domain specific libraries; and be able to learn new languages
and new libraries when needed. They should be familiar with concepts in applied mathematics,
covering multivariate calculus, linear algebra, optimization, and graph theory, in addition to
concepts in probability and basic methods in statistics. They should be sufficiently literate to
read practitioner-oriented papers that contain descriptions of methods in basic mathematics and
statistics terminology, and high-level descriptions of algorithms and experimental results. They
should also be familiar with several public data depositories that may serve as application
examples to illustrate methodologies.

_**Flexibility and joy of learning and working in a fast-paced discipline:**_

Data Science is a rapidly evolving discipline that sees development of new techniques, tools, and
application domains every day. A DS graduate needs to be prepared to pursue continuous
learning from colleagues, professional peers, and the community through various on-line sources
and conferences, and be able to learn from experience.


37

<!-- fin de página 38 -->

_**Broad interest in application domains, and preferably, with a few specializations:**_

Most Data Science graduates will work in an application discipline, driving forward exciting
change and innovation in a business or other type of institution. Analytic methods learned in
school are often generic and neutral to application domains. A Data Science graduate needs to
understand the mission, challenges, and constraints of the application domain so as to guide the
focus of the analysis and the selection of methods. This requires broad interests, strong curiosity,
fast learning, accurate communication, and empathy of and dedication to the clients’ key
concerns. These abilities are often amplified when the data science graduate has passion and
intrinsic interest in the application domain.

_**Staying alert of broader societal, non-technical concerns:**_

The work environment of Data Science graduates operates in and interacts with a broader society
through its lines of business. Collecting and using data from certain sources may need to take
into account the societal impact. Data Science graduates should stay knowledgeable of current
affairs, and stay alert of any sensitivity on privacy, security, and bias related issues, so as to plan
and deliver studies with such concerns in mind.

_**Strong communication skills:**_

Data science graduates will need to learn about a topic of concern from clients of the hosting
institution, and deliver results back to the clients in an understandable way.

Knowledge and goal acquisition: The clients are often experts in other areas or are decision
makers, and are not familiar with data science technology. The Data Science graduate needs to
be able to identify the relevant analytic issues from the client’s concerns through dialogs or
documents in the client’s preferred terminology. These require clear thinking, fluent
communication skills, ability to ask the right questions, in addition to good interpersonal skills
for building lasting engagement and collaborations.

Result delivery: Likewise, on presentation of results, the Data Science graduate needs to explain
and interpret the numerical conclusions in the client’s terminology, and deliver text and graphics
ready to be digested by non-technical personnel.


_**Commitment to professional responsibility:**_


Graduates need to be aware of relevant social, legal, ethical, and cultural issues when working
with various data sets and deriving meaning through data science. In addition, awareness and
understanding of the different international cultural and legal implications is critical. As
practicing professionals, they must understand their responsibility and the possible consequences
of their work. They must understand the limitations of the tools they use and their own personal
limitations. A strong ethical dimension in the work of a graduate is important to be alert to bias,
both in the tools they use and in data and the sampling of data.

### **Chapter 7: Challenges for Institutions**

Institutions offering an undergraduate degree in Data Science face a number of challenges. Who
should host such an offering? An Institute or School of Data Science? A Department of Data
Science? Should it be an interdisciplinary program? Or should it be housed as one of many
offerings within a more broadly based unit or set of academic units? The particular choice is
likely to depend on the philosophy underpinning institutional organization: is it research based, is
it based on industrial considerations or is it education based? Inevitably personalities will play a
role, reflecting the expertise, perspectives, interests and ambitions of individuals.

_**Administrative Challenges**_

The interdisciplinary nature of Data Science can create challenges for the administrative
structure of an institution. It is vitally important that there is in place a structure that is fully
supportive of the program, giving due attention to the wellbeing of the students and the faculty
involved in the delivery of the curriculum. Support needs to be provided to ensure the ongoing
health and development of the discipline and its promotion both within the institution and within
the wider community.

_**Marketing of the Program**_

The marketing of a degree program will be a central concern. To establish a certain momentum,
it is important to have cohorts of a reasonable size. Yet Data Science is a relatively new
discipline, unfamiliar to many career advisors, parents or guardians who can exercise influence,
or even to applicants themselves. Accordingly, information about the program has to provide a
sharp and focused description of the discipline, provide a brief outline of what is involved in
studying the discipline, explain some of the major accomplishments and relevance of Data
Science, and give an indication of career opportunities. Further, it needs to be prominent and of
high quality with an identified faculty contact.

One area that merits particular concern is ensuring that the program is attractive to diverse
audiences, including, for example, women and ethnic minorities. This necessitates a holistic
approach involving broad consideration of all aspects from marketing, to the curriculum, to the
ethos and atmosphere associated with the degree program.

One way of attracting interest from students is to offer a very imaginative and highly motivating
course to first year students and to have that open to a broad spectrum of students. If students
find this sufficiently appealing, they may well opt for Data Science as a major.

_**Faculty Considerations**_

In some institutions, often in the US, departments are being encouraged by administration (with
pressure from trustees, in some cases) to start Data Science programs. Those most
frequently pushed in this direction are in Computer Science, Statistics and Mathematics
departments who may already be facing staffing challenges and growing numbers of students.


39

<!-- fin de página 40 -->

Then strong leadership is required to address such challenges.

Central to the delivery of a Data Science program is a collection of faculty members who have
expertise in research / scholarship in data science. Of course they should be committed educators
who can motivate and properly support students. Faculty should be particularly alert to the needs
of the students. Given the newness of Data Science and the breadth of it, students will be taking
courses for a Data Science program/major from a wide range of faculty across an institution.
This poses a challenge in ensuring that all faculty are on board with the aims, objectives and
ethos of the program and reflect this in their approach.

A valuable aspect of study is often lectures given by invited lecturers from industry. Faculty
members can assist in organizing relevant talks and meetings. Student societies, prizes for
exceptional student work, drawing attention to competitions and opportunities as well as having
appropriately imaginative displays are all aspects that faculty can facilitate.

_**Implementation of the Curriculum**_

This Data Science volume provides guidance on education at the undergraduate level on the
computing aspects of a Data Science program. Its instantiation in any one institution is likely to
be governed by many factors such as the wider environment, the number of students in a cohort,
and so on. Institutions are encouraged to consider how best to integrate the recommendations of
this report into the existing provisions. A flexible approach is encouraged (with institutions
‘playing to their strengths’ in Computer Science, Statistics and Mathematics); the identification
of T1, T2 and E(lective) learning outcomes has been undertaken to further encourage and
facilitate just that.

Students will inevitably experience applications during their study and the range should be
broad. Beyond this, through options / electives, students can be given the opportunity to study
topics in some detail so that they can be better informed about possible areas of application.

In the teaching of Data Science, the ethical issues should be seen to pervade the whole
curriculum. The privacy and confidentiality of information is a vital matter and must be treated
with the utmost care and attention. During their education as well as in their professional lives,
ethical issues have to be seen to receive attention.

_**Data Science Minors**_

A Data Science minor will include a number of core modules but will fall short of a full
program. The intention should be to allow students from other disciplines to gain a solid
understanding of the principles and potential of Data Science with a view to their application in
other fields of endeavour.

An important aspect of the existence of minors is the creation of links with other departments.
Such links should lead to greater understanding and hopefully mutually beneficial collaboration.


40

<!-- fin de página 41 -->

_**Resources**_

In terms of resources to support Data Science, languages (such as Python) are an important
consideration. It is desirable that the language implementation should include libraries to support
Data Science and so various aspects of visualization, statistics, and machine learning. Moreover,
there should be software to support the teaching of relevant mathematics.

But different communities prefer different languages, popular alternatives to Python being Scala
or Java; Python alone is often considered ineffective for processing Big Data. Then there should
be available multi-server cluster resources such as an Apache Spark or an Apache Hadoop
cluster, or other cluster resource that facilitates the storage and processing of Big Data. The
cluster might be on the premises (on-prem) of the home institution or in a public, private, or
hybrid cloud. A single server is not sufficient.

Again, for the purposes of dealing with Big Data, tools for topics such as visualization, machine
learning, etc. need to run in a distributed fashion. Running on a single server is typically not
sufficient.

Most clusters are Linux-based. Accordingly, students will need access to Linux command line
training to learn how to navigate and run code from the command line. There need to be cluster
administrators who maintain the cluster hardware and software and support the user community.

Beyond the basic languages and related tools, students should have access to web services that
are relevant to Data Science as well as data sets of various kinds. During their studies the
attention of students should be drawn to important collections of data.

Appropriate financial resources may be needed to ensure appropriate access to staff, equipment,
resources, laboratories, web services, etc.

_**Keeping current**_

Given the rate at which Data Science is evolving as a discipline, students need to be guided in
how to keep current in terms of their knowledge and skills. The availability of online material is
important in this regard. One possible set of resources are offered as MOOCs; students would
benefit from guidance on how to use a wide variety of relevant resources effectively and indeed
how to identify those of quality.

Remaining current can also be facilitated by being a member of a network of similarly minded
professionals. Again, guidance can be provided on how best to proceed on this topic.

#### **Analysis and Presentation (AP)**

The human computer interface provides the means whereby users interact with computer
systems. The quality of that interface significantly affects usability in all its forms and
encompasses a vast range of technologies: animation, visualisation, simulation, speech, video,
recognition (of faces, of hand-writing, etc.) and graphics. For the data scientist, it is important to
be aware of the range of options and possibilities, and to be able to deploy these as appropriate.
Through the use of graphs and other forms of diagrams, visualisation can be used in providing
readily understood summaries but can also greatly assist in guiding such activities as clustering
and classification.

#### **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) includes the methodologies for modelling and simulating several
human abilities that are widely accepted as representing intelligence. Perceiving, representing,
learning, planning, and reasoning with knowledge and evidence are key themes.

Concepts and methods developed for building AI systems are useful in Data Science.
For example, knowledge graphs such as semantic ontologies are both used and generated by data
scientists. Computer vision algorithms can be used in analysis of image data; speech and natural
language processing algorithms can be applied in analysis of speech or text data. Machine
learning algorithms are applied extensively to extract patterns from data. Thus, a student who is
well versed in AI will be able to apply those techniques in a Data Science context.

Conversely, Data Science methods are applied extensively in AI systems. Data Science students
should have an understanding of AI systems and the way they work, if they plan to apply their
work to AI.

Due to their centrality in Data Science, AI competencies related to images, text, and machine

how to derive insights that prove useful. These matters are addressed below under the headings
of problems of scale, data storage, high performance computing, and complexity theory. These
topics include a range of techniques typically used in addressing the problems of scale. Such
systems can be complex and so consideration is given also to software support for Big Data
applications.

**DG-Data Acquisition – T1**

As the initial step in data governance policies, data acquisition is the process of obtaining raw
data from real-world objects. The process of data acquisition should fully consider the physical
properties of the subject, and at the same time consider the characteristics of the data application.
Due to the limited resources available during data acquisition (such as network bandwidth,
sensor node energy, website tokens, etc.), it is necessary to effectively design data collection
techniques to maximize valuable data within limited resources and minimize valueless data. Also
due to resource constraints, the data acquisition process is unlikely to obtain all the information
of the data description object, so the data acquisition technology needs to be carefully designed
to minimize the deviation between the collected data and the real objects.

#### **Data Mining (DM)**

At its core, Data Mining involves the processing, analysis, and presentation of data in order to
gain valuable information. An important prerequisite is that appropriate data of a high quality has
been prepared and is relevant to the task at hand. The basic types of analysis include clustering,
classification, regression, pattern mining, prediction, association and outlier detection with
attention being given to various forms of data including time series data and web data. Many of
these concepts depend on the notion of data proximity.

**PR-Continuing Professional Development – T1**

The essence of a professional is being competent in certain aspects of data science. It is the
responsibility of the professionals to undertake only tasks for which they are competent. There
are then implications for keeping up-to-date in a manner that is demonstrable to stakeholders
(e.g. employers).

**PR-Communication – T1**


There are various contexts in which the data scientist is required to undertake communication
with very diverse audiences. That communication may be oral, written or electronic. There is
often the need to engage in discussion about the role that data science can play, to communicate
multiple aspects of the data science process with colleagues, to convey results that may lead to
change or may provide new insights. Being able to articulate the need for change and being
sensitive to the consequences of change are important professional attributes. These activities
may entail the ability to have a discussion about limitations in certain contexts and to suggest
research activities.

Communication from the data scientist must be underpinned by an evidence-based approach to
decision making. There is special significance to this in the context of machine learning and
automation where the reasons for decisions may require clarification.

An important consequence of developments in machine learning is the ability of machines to
understand natural language (and so voice input), which can then be employed in such contexts
as robotics, word processors or intelligence driven search engines (e.g. Siri, Cortana, Google
Assistant, Alexa).

captured extensively in [1]. Underpinning these activities is a view that professionals should
undertake only tasks for which they are competent, and even then should carry out such tasks in
a way that reflects good practice in its many forms. Maintaining or extending competence is
essential. A heightened awareness of legal and ethical issues must underpin the work of the data
scientist. Professionals should consider the ethical issues associated with their decisions as a very
important starting point that enables them to recognize themselves as “independent, ethical
agents.”
